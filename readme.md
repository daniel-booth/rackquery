** Rackquery **

This script will take either a hostname or IP address, and query our Racktables database for information. Tab completion is available if you can't quite remember the hostname. Passing a portion of a hostname will render a list of all device hostnames that contain that string, IE passing 'amout' will output data for amout05-9.
